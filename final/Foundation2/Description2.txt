Description of Foundation 2 program

In this project, I have implemented the encapsulation principle by creating separate classes for Product,
Order, Customer, and Address. Each class encapsulates its own data and behavior, ensuring that the internal
implementation details are hidden from other classes. The Product class encapsulates product details, such
as the name, ID, price, and quantity, providing a clear and organized structure for managing product-related
information. The Order class encapsulates the concept of an order, including a list of products and a customer,
allowing for easy manipulation and calculation of total price and shipping cost. The Customer class encapsulates
customer information, like the name and address, protecting the data and providing methods to access and manipulate
it in a controlled manner. The Address class encapsulates address-related details, enabling the generation of full
address strings and checking if the address is from the USA. This implementation of encapsulation improves code
organization, data hiding, and separation of concerns, resulting in maintainable and reusable code.
