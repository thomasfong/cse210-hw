Description of Foundation 1 program

In developing the YouTube video program, I have applied the abstraction principle. By utilizing the Video and Comment classes,
I have abstracted away unnecessary complexities and focused on the core attributes and functionalities. The Video class provides
a simplified representation of a video, emphasizing details like the title, author, and length. Similarly, the Comment class
encapsulates comment-related information, such as the commenter's name and text. This abstraction has improved the overall
code by enhancing maintainability, readability, and emphasizing the essential aspects of the program's logic.
